\section{Overview}

\begin{itemize}
	\item This coursework is a game entitled ``Swarm".
	\item The human plays as a large ball which can be red, green or blue.
	\item The aim is to control the players ball such that it collides with smaller enemy balls.
	\item Enemy balls can also be either red, green or blue.
	\item Hitting a ball which {\bf is not} the colour of the player increases the total points. This is what the player should be attempting to do. Once collided with an enemy ball will removed from play.
	\item Hitting a ball which {\bf is} the same colour as the player results in a penalty. The player should avoid doing this.
	\item All this takes place in a birds eye view of an arena filled with walls and holes.
	\item Balls cannot pass through walls, but can fall down holes (which removes the ball from play).
	\item The player can cycle the their colour using the space bar.
	\item Enemy balls of the same colour as the player will be attracted to the player, whereas enemy balls of a different colour will be repelled.
	\item Therefor the player is always being chased by enemy balls of the same colour which (if they hit the player) inflict a penalty of 5 points. Whilst the player is at the same time chasing enemy balls which are a different colour (which are running away) for point increases.
	\item If the player falls down a hole then its game over.
	\item If an enemy ball falls down a hole, points are awarded to the player as if they had collided according to the colour of the enemy ball and the player.
	\item Sometimes if an enemy ball collides with another enemy ball at a high enough speed, the slower ball will change colour to that of the faster impacting ball, making things a little harder.
	\item The game has several tutorial levels with on screen explanations and specifically places enemies to introduce the player to the mechanics of the game.
	\item Completing the tutorial levels leads into 3 levels with many more enemies which are randomly placed.
	\item Completing all the levels displays a high score screen, depicting the players score relative to past scores.
	\item If the player falls down a hole any remaining levels are skipped and the current score is entered in the high score list and shown to the player as with the previous bullet point.
	\item Once on the high score screen clicking anywhere starts the game again from the first scoring level (i.e. not the tutorial levels).
	\item Before starting a welcome screen explains the game in short and clicking anywhere starts the game.
	\item The player progresses to the next level when all enemy balls have been removed from play.
