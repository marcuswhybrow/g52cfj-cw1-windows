\section{Requirements}

\subsection{Draw an appropriate background}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The drawing of tiles is taken care of by the \verb!GameTileManager! class which is a subclass of \verb!TileManager!.
	\item The \verb!DrawTileAt! method has been overridden to draw 5 different types of tile. These are \emph{empty space}, \emph{vertical wall}, \emph{horizontal wall}, \emph{intersection wall} and \emph{hole}. The three wall tiles and the hole are drawn using the \verb!JPGImage! class from images created in Photoshop, whereas all empty space tiles are drawn as a grey rectangle.
	\item This class also contains new methods for testing whether an \verb!Actor! (base class for ball) will collide with a particular tile. Collision detection is done separately for each axis so you will see methods such as \verb!CheckCollisionVertical! and the private methods for checking collision for each of the different possible tiles (e.g. \verb!CollisionVerticalWallVertical!).
	\item The background changes due to player interaction when the player ball picks up a powerup. This is handled in the \verb!Player::CheckPowerups! method which is called at the very end of the \verb!Player::DoUpdate! method. The \verb!Player! gets the tile from the manager which it is currently on, and then evaluates whether there is a powerup in that tile, and whether or not the player ball is intersecting it. If it is the tile is replaces with an \emph{empty} tile and a method is called on the \verb!Player! to enable that power up.
	\item \verb!GameMain::SetupBackgroundBuffer! is overridden to draw a tiled background using the aforementioned \verb!GameTileManager! in the \verb!PLAYING! state and a grey background for the \verb!INTRO!, \verb!COMPLETED!, \verb!GAME_OVER! and \verb!HIGH_SCORES! states.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Have moving objects}

\begin{itemize}
	\item This game has multiple moving objects, one is controlled by the player and the rest are controlled by the game (AI).
	\item The \verb!Actor! base class inherits from \verb!DisplayableObject! and overrides the the \verb!DoUpdate! method to change the position of each actor based upon its current velocity, after tacking into account any obstacles such as walls.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Have interaction between the moving objects and the background}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \verb!Actor!s cannot pass through walls and fall down holes, this effect is upheld by collision logic contained with the (for example) \verb!GameTileManager::CheckCollisionHorizontal! method and checked on \verb!DoUpdate! in each \verb!Actor!.
	\item The \verb!Infected! (enemy ball) which inherits from \verb!Actor! is placed in a new level at a random position in its constructor, but only inside of tiles which are empty spaces. This is another level of (pre) interaction between movable objects and the background.
	\item When an actor is colliding with a hole background tile it puts the \verb!Actor! into a state where it animates the ball so it appears to fall down the hole. The movement of the ball is directed towards the the centre of the hole, and the ball stops moving when it reaches the centre.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Provide user interaction by handling keyboard or mouse input}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The \verb!Player::DoUpdate! method gets the current x an y positions of the mouse, and calculates the angle necessary to point the player at the mouse, and then sets the player ball direction to be that angle.
	\item \verb!DoUpdate! also makes a call to \verb!Player::CheckKeys! which watches for the space key being released (as in pressed down and then released again) and then cycles the colour of the player ball to the next colour. This is what allows the player ball to change from red to green to blue and back to red again.
	\item \verb!GameMain::KeyUp! is overridden to provide some extra game wide functionality. The \verb!S! key when released and the game is in the \verb!INTRO! state starts the game at the first non-training level. When \verb!S! is pressed in the \verb!PLAYING! state the level is ended and the next level begins (skipping the level). And when \verb!H! is pressed in the \verb!INTRO! state the game changes to the \verb!HIGH_SCORES! state displaying the high scores list.
	\item \verb!GameMain::KeyDown! is overridden to provide actions more quickly (i.e. when the key is pressed down, not released). Pressing \verb!Esc! whilst in the INTRO state exits the game, whereas pressing it in any other state returns the game back to the \verb!INTRO! state.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Provide AI-controlled objects}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \verb!Infected! objects are controlled completely by the game, the position of the \verb!Player! instance and the \verb!Player! instance's state.
	\item The \verb!Infected::DoUpdate! method calculates the angle at which it must point in order to face the player, and then its angle is updated to this angle every frame.
	\item The speed with which the \verb!Infected! object travels towards the \verb!Player! is determined in the \verb!DoUpdate! method by its proximity to the player. It increases in speed the closer it gets, creating a lunging animation whenever the player ball draws near. When a certain distance from the player an \verb!Infected! will not move, giving the impression of a certain area of perception.
	\item Each \verb!Infected! asks the \verb!Player! instance whether or not it should be chasing the player ball or running from it in the \verb!DoUpdate! method, this logic is contained with the a method called \verb!Player::ShouldAttract! and the returned boolean is determined by the current colour of the player ball, the colour of the \verb!Infected! calling the method and any powerups which the player ball might have active.
	\item The final thing the \verb!DoUpdate! method does is call the \verb!Infected::CheckIntersections! method, which iterates over all other actors and for each checks if this actor is colliding with that actor. If it is, and that actor is infectable as determined by a method called \verb!bool Actor::IsInfectable!, the slower \verb!Actor! assumes the colour of the faster one. This method also checks if this \verb!Infected! intersects with player, and asks the game to remove this \verb!Infected! if it does.
	\item If removed from play the \verb!Infected::HasBeenRemoved! method is called. The game is given points or penalised points for killing the \verb!Infected!.
	\item \verb!TutorialInfected! objects subclass \verb!Infected! and work in the exact same way, however in \verb!TutorialInfected::HasBeenRemoved! they progress the game to the next level, allowing for completion of training levels before every single \verb!Infected! has been killed.
