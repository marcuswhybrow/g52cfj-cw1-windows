The SDL files are provided in this zip file for the convenience of the students for academic use only, for the purpose of working on this coursework.

Please be aware that all of these files are available only under a license and that you should not redistribute these without being aware of the license details.

SDL_image: GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
See http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
Then they also include the libtiff.dll, jpeg.dll and llibpng12-0.dll files.

SDL_ttf: GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, 
see http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
See here for packages: http://www.noquarterarcade.com/using-cygwin-for-sdl-development
The bin directory includes: zlib1.dll, SDL_ttf and libfreetype-6.dll

I have provided recent versions of both zip files in the sources directory.

The license conditions from each zip are in the files in this directory.

Fonts:
The provided font is a free font obtained from http://www.webpagepublicity.com/free-fonts.html
You can feel free to select an alternative font and use that instead.
You can also use one of the fonts installed on the machine already if you wish.

Compiling on Mac or Linux machine:
I suggest you install the packages/libraries for SDL_image, SDL_ttf and all of their dependencies. In theory, it should then be able to build the project. I haven't been able to do this in advance.
If you get a working project then if you zip it up I am happy to put it on the web page for others and to credit you on the page.
